## :zap: About

This GitHub repository demonstrates a range of Python projects varying in complexity and utility. 

**It includes:**

**BMI Calculator: A simple GUI application using Tkinter to calculate Body Mass Index.**

**Instagram Stalker Bot: Uses Selenium to download images from Instagram based on specific tags.**

**Pythonic Alarm: A Tkinter-based application that allows setting up alarms on your computer.**

**Rock Paper Scissors Game: A fun, interactive game developed with Tkinter, showcasing basic AI implementation.**

### Each project is designed to highlight different programming concepts and tools, from GUI development with Tkinter to web scraping with Selenium.

## :zap: Usage

**BMI Calculator**: Run the BMI_calculator.py file. Enter your height and weight in the GUI to receive your BMI.

**Instagram Stalker Bot:** Execute Instagram_Stalker_Bot_Download_Images_from_Any_Tag.py and specify the tag to download images.

**Pythonic Alarm:** Launch Pythonic_Alarm_with_Tkinter.py, set the desired time in the GUI, and wait for the alarm.

**Rock Paper Scissors Game:** Start Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game.py and play against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors.


### :zap: Development
To develop and run these projects, ensure you have the following installed:

‚û°Ô∏èPython 3.x

‚û°Ô∏èTkinter for GUI-based projects (BMI_calculator.py, Pythonic_Alarm_with_Tkinter.py, Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game.py)

‚û°Ô∏èSelenium for the Instagram bot (Instagram_Stalker_Bot_Download_Images_from_Any_Tag.py)

‚û°Ô∏èGit for version control

‚û°Ô∏èVisual Studio Code (VSCode) as the recommended IDE

‚û°Ô∏èAppropriate web drivers for Selenium (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)

‚û°Ô∏èJupyter Notebook for testing and prototyping Python code
